I've spent about a month working on Brainy, a survey API that can collect data from your forms. 

## Features
- Dashboard with table
- Redirecting after submitting a form
- Download/view/fetch JSON data
- Download CSV data
- Create/rename/delete surveys
- Create/rename/delete input fields
- Change privacy
- End surveys

To test it out, create a new HTML repl, create a new account and survey in Brainy, and follow the instructions in the docs or in the code page for the survey. 

Here's a demo of the dashboard:

And here's a demo form that uses Brainy: https://survey.ruiwenge2.repl.co

## I hope you found this useful!
